See it live at https://weatherapp-limosys.herokuapp.com/

It is hosted on a free indtance, which can take a while to spin up, do not worry if it takes a long time to load. 

## Installation

To install, clone and pull down this repo. create a .env file in the root directory and add a variable with your own api key from https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up --> REACT_APP_API_KEY = Your API key  

## How to Run
After the API key is set up, in your console, install npm ( if you dont have it already) with  "npm install npm@latest -g" 
After that finishes installing, run "npm install" to install all the dependencies. 
If all went well, run "npm start" and the app will launch in your browser on port 3000.
Launch  it in your browser (if it didn't by default) by entering http://localhost:3000/ in your browser address bar. 

## Technologies
This app was built using REACT, the OpenWeatherMap API, using the newer features that came with the addition of hooks in 2018 to react.
